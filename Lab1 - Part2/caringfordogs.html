  <h2>Why Adoption Is A Good Option</h2>
  <p>Each year, many dogs are unethically bred in puppy mills or are abused by owners and sent away. Animal shelters
  provide transitional care to many wonderful dogs who are in great need of a home. If you or someone you know are considering
  getting a dog, we urge you to consider adoption, and to think of all the sweet, loving pups who would love to make
  you their forever family. A dog can become a man's best friend, and a shelter dog may just become yours. </p>

  the <a href="https://www.gdrne.com/adopt/"> Great Dog Rescue New England</a> or the <a href="https://www.northeastanimalshelter.org/"> Northeast Animal Shelter</a>.</p>
